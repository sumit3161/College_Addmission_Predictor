# College_Admission_Predictor

### Individual Project:

### About project:-
In this project, I explored and visualized datasets using pandas and matplotlib, focusing on data cleaning and feature analysis. I implemented multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN) and used GridSearchCV to identify the best algorithm for predicting graduate school admission chances. A Linear Regression model was developed to predict admission probabilities based on GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and research experience. Throughout the project, I demonstrated strong Python programming skills, leveraging libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
### Tech Stack:

* Data Analysis and Visualization: Demonstrated proficiency in exploring and visualizing datasets using pandas and
 matplotlib, including data cleaning, feature analysis, and distribution plotting.

* Machine Learning Model Development: Implemented various regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso, SVR,
 Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN) and used GridSearchCV to identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting
 graduate school admission chances.

* Predictive Modeling: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict the probability of admission to graduate
 programs based on factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and research experience.

*  Python Programming: Showcased strong Python skills, utilizing libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and
 matplotlib to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks
